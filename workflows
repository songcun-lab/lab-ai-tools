# Add judgment framework for evaluating CLI AI tools

Songcun Lab · Judgment Framework (v1)

> This is not a benchmark.  
> This is a judgment framework built from real daily work.

---

## 0. Boundary Conditions

I do NOT judge AI tools under demo or showcase scenarios.

I only evaluate tools when:

- The task is real, daily, and repeatable
- The task reflects at least 60% of my actual workload
- The tool is used in a natural working rhythm, not a staged prompt

Any conclusion outside these boundaries is ignored.

---

## 1. Rule One: Context Continuity > Single Command Accuracy

The key question is not:

> “Is this command correct?”

But rather:

> “Does the tool understand what I am doing?”

I observe:

- Whether the tool remembers previous steps
- Whether it builds on context instead of restarting
- Whether I need to restate background repeatedly

---

## 2. Rule Two: Decision Friction Matters More Than Speed

I care less about speed, and more about mental load.

I ask myself:

- Do I need to think hard about *how* to ask?
- Do I need to pre-structure my thoughts for the tool?
- Am I adapting to the tool, or is the tool adapting to me?

Good tools reduce decision friction.

## 3. Rule Three: Can It Work With Incomplete Inputs?

Real work is messy:

- Half-written commands
- Incomplete configs
- Unclear intentions

I judge whether the tool can:

- Continue with partial input
- Offer direction instead of demanding perfection
- Evolve the solution step by step

---

## 4. Rule Four: Collaboration Beats Obedience

I do not treat CLI AI as a command generator.

I expect:

- Explanations, not just outputs
- Warnings when risks exist
- Suggestions when I am likely wrong

A good tool thinks *with* me.

---

## 5. Rule Five: Fit to Real Workflow > Product Design Assumptions

I value tools that respect:

- CLI thinking rhythm
- Interruptions and corrections
- Backtracking and iteration

I distrust tools that only shine in idealized flows.

---

## 6. Rule Six: Long-Term Willingness Test

My final question:

> “If I use this every day for 6 months, would I want to?”

Signals include:

- Lower cognitive fatigue
- Growing trust, not resistance
- Focus stays on the problem, not the tool

---

## 7. Expression Principle

All judgments are:

- Context-dependent
- Task-specific
- Open to revision

This framework produces **first judgments**, not final truths.

---

## Closing Note

I do not rank AI tools by capability ceiling.

I judge them by one standard:

> Whether they help me think and move forward  
> in real work.
